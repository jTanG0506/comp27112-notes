# Introduction to Image Synthesis

A **vector display** is a type of display in which an electron beam draws lines and text as instructed. As the name suggests, it is only capable of drawing vectors and is usually monochrome.

A **raster graphic** uses a 2D array of pixels to represent the image. Images must be sampled and the more samples, the better fidelity. However, raster graphics will always be an approximation.

### What is OpenGL?
OpenGL stands for **Open Graphics Library** is a cross-platform and language-independent API for doing 2D and 3D computer graphics. It is the most widely used 2D and 3D graphics API, with common uses in industry, engineering, CAD, CGI, research, education, etc.

#### Fixed pipeline

| ---- | ---- |
| it's simple to use and sufficient for many purposes | new algorithms and techniques can't be added |
| it is easy to get started in a short time for beginners | it's deprecated! |

#### Programmable pipeline
