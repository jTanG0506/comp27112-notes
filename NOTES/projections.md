# Projections

The process of converting all 3D coordinates into suitable 2D coordinates for displaying on the screen is known as **projection**.

## Parallel projection
The **projection** is the set of points at which the **projectors intersect** the projection plane. Parallel edges remain parallel in the projection, however angles between edges may be **distorted**. The centre of projection is at **infinity**, hence the projectors are parallel.
