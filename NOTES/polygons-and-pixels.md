# Polygons and pixels

In 3D graphics, the most common building block is the **polygon** and the most common polygon is the **triangle**. A polygon is the space bounded by a set of edges between pairs of verticies in a ordered set. **Structured** polygons maintain a hierarchy of structure: Object {% math %}\rightarrow{% endmath %} Surfaces {% math %}\rightarrow{% endmath %} Polygons {% math %}\rightarrow{% endmath %} Edges / Vertices

OpenGL only renders **convex** polygons, those whose interior angles are each less than {% math %}180\degree{% endmath %}. A non-convex polygon is known as a **concave** polygon. For concave polygons, GLU provides functions to tessellate them into a set of convex polygons. We say that a polygon is **planar** if all its vertices lie in a single plane - for example, all triangles are planar.
